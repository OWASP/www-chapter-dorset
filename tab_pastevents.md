### 2022-10 Deepfakes: A Growing Cybersecurity Concern (Meetup #17)
##### Location: Online
##### Time: 18:30 - 19:30
--- Join us for a look at Deepfakes with Mike Warner (one of our OWASP Dorset Chapter Leads)

##### Mike Warner
Deepfakes; an emergent type of threat falling under the greater and more pervasive umbrella of synthetic media, utilise a form of Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to create believable, realistic videos, pictures, audio, and text of events which never happened.

Criminals are already starting to utilise deepfake technology to impersonate executives' voices on phone calls and even their likenesses over video to add an air of legitimacy to their attacks. As deepfakes become more lifelike, phone calls, video chats and other forms of communication will be more vulnerable to abuse.

This talk with look at the origins of Deepfake technology, how they work, the threats and ethical quandaries they pose, and potential mitigations, with a handful of demos.([PDF](assets/presentations/2022-10/OWASP_Deepfakes-A_Growing_Cybersecurity_Concern.pdf "wikilink"))([VIDEO - coming soon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMKP6kbpkx3yC2K5u0bHE1g))

##### Nikki Webb
--- [Respect In Security](https://respectinsecurity.org/), three very simple yet important words, it may sound like a fairly obvious statement but sadly it is not, according to our research, more than a third of Infosec professionals have experienced harassment or abuse from their peers. The other founders of Respect in Security and I, have taken a stand to help encourage more positive and inclusive behaviour and to help support those victims of harassment. I will be telling you all a little more about how we are planning on doing just that. ([VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpoRwKr-vds&t=1165s))    
If you have been a victim of online harassment you can contact [The Cyber Helpline](https://www.thecyberhelpline.com/) for immediate advice. If you are a victim of cyber crime you are advised to report the crime immediately to [Action Fraud](http://www.actionfraud.police.uk/report_fraud) or in Scotland to [Police Scotland](http://www.scotland.police.uk/contact-us/report-cybercrime)

##### Dr. Alexios Mylonas (Program Leader for the BSc (Hons) Forensic Computing and Security @ Bournemouth University. Lecturer in Computing.)
--- I Know What You Did Last Summer: New persistent tracking mechanisms used in the wild
    Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database allow web browsers to store information in the client in a much more advanced way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They were originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will be divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of these three primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done by performing a large-scale analysis on the usage of these techniques in the wild. The second part reviews the effectiveness of the removal of client-side storage data in modern browsers.([PDF](assets/presentations/2019-01/OWASP_Dorset_Chapter_Meeting_Jan_2019_Talk_2_Web_Tracking.pdf "wikilink")])
