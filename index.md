With a real life case study, we'll be exploring three analysis tools - Cyber Kill Chains, Diamond Models and the Intelligence cycle. David will show how you can use these tools to understand what your adversary is actually doing, how close to 'the Crown Jewels' they've got, how to find their identity, their attributes and most importantly of all, what you can do to stop them.

#### TALKS:
##### OWASP Dorset Introduction
Welcome, news and an update on OWASP Projects & Events from the OWASP Dorset Chapter Leader.
##### OWASP Projects - Open Source Security at its finest
Overview of OWASP Projects Top 3 Flagship, Lab and Incubator | Focusing on how to fire up your stance on security with minimal investment.
##### I know what you did last summer
New persistent tracking mechanisms used in the wild. Web Storage, Indexed Database API and Web SQL Database allow web browsers to store information in the client in a much more advanced way compared to other techniques, such as HTTP Cookies. They were originally introduced with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of websites, however, they are often exploited as a way of tracking users across multiple sessions and websites. The presentation will be divided into two parts. First, it will quantify the usage of these three primitives in the context of user tracking. This is done by performing a large-scale analysis on the usage of these techniques in the wild. The second part reviews the effectiveness of the removal of client-side storage data in modern browsers.
