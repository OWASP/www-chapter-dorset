### Dorset Chapter Information
Founded in 2019 by Daniel Warden we aim to develop a dynamic and vibrant community based on Open Source Security in Dorset. Our events are free and everyone is welcome. Join us at a chapter meeting to contribute, listen and learn. Every year we plan to hold at least 5 events consisting of 4 talks (meetups) and 1 Capture The Flag (CTF).
