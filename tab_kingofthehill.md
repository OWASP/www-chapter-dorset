King of the Hill (KoTH) is a competitive hacking game, where you play against 10 other hackers to compromise a machine and then patch its vulnerabilities to stop other players from also gaining access. The longer you maintain your access, the more points you get.

We will be running a tournament on TryHackMe's King of the Hill game mode. There will be prizes given out at the end.
